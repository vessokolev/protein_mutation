NOTE: The residue file names have an extension ".res"

* Choosing the residue file name:

   Each and every of the residue files, stored inside this directory,
   represents a protein residue description. The name of the file MUST
   match the name of the residue, in LOWER CASE letters (mandatory).
   The list of protein residues is defined as "pro_residues" in the
   file "make_residue_database.py".


* Data columns defined inside the file:

   IT IS MANDATORY: The columns defined in every residue file must be
   separated by at least one empty space.

   Column  1: The name of the atom in the described residue description,
              in MOLARIS force field name notation. NOTE that the
              sequence of atom names in Column 1 should match the
              sequence for the same residue that appear in the examined
              PDB files.

   Column  2: The name of the atom in the described residue description,
              in AMBER99 force field name notation.

   Column  3: The AMBER99 force field atom type.

   Column  4: The atomic charge in relative (to the elementary charge)
              units.

   Column  5: The 12-6 Lennard-Jones sigma parameter, in nm.

   Column  6: The 12-6 Lennard-Jones epsilon parameter, in kj/mol.

   Column  7: x-coordinate of the atom in Angstroms (see Note 1 bellow)

   Column  8: y-coordinate of the atom in Angstroms (see Note 1 bellow)

   Column  9: z-coordinate of the atom in Angstroms (see Note 1 bellow)

   Column 10: Chain "role" of the atom (see Note 2 bellow)


* Notes:

 ** Note 1:

    The coordinates of each atom, listed in columns 7-9  x, y, z are
    taken from some example PDB protein topology. In the sample PDB
    from where the atom coordinates are taken, the bond angles and lengths
    are set close to their optimal values.

 ** Note 2:

    The chain "role" is not related to any formalism involving the force
    field parameters. It is just a number who helps the program code to
    recognize the type of the atom regardless its atom name. Given bellow
    are the implemented values and their meaning:
    
       -3 - the C atom of the main chain
       -2 - the N atom of the main chain
       -1 - the CA atom
        0 - the HN and O atoms
        1 - the side chain atoms (excluding the CB atom)
        2 - the HA atom (the one connected to CA)
        3 - the CB atom
