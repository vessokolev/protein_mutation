NOTE: The residue file names have an extension ".top"

* Choosing the residue topology file name:

   Each and every of the residue topology files, stored inside this
   directory, represents a protein residue topology, consisting of
   the structural elements required for generating different conformers
   of the side chain. The name of the file MUST match the name of the
   residue, in LOWER CASE letters (mandatory). The list of protein
   residues is defined as "pro_residues" in the file
   "make_residue_database.py".

* Describing branches of atoms to rotate over the defined axes:

  The bonds have to be entered as "BND" record. Every record should
  follow the structure:
  
  BND  1  2
  
  where 1 and 2 are some atom serial numbers (these numbers are
  taken from the corresponding mol2 file).
